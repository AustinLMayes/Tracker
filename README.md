Tracker
=======
[![Build Status](https://ci.avicus.net/job/Tracker/badge/icon)](https://ci.avicus.net/job/Tracker/)

Bukkit plugin and API for tracking entity damage.

Compatible with CraftBukkit 1.8, but it's recommended you use either [Spigot 1.8](https://getspigot.org/) or [PaperSpigot 1.8](https://ci.destroystokyo.com/job/PaperSpigot/).

See [Grave](https://github.com/Avicus/Grave) for a simple implementation of this API.
